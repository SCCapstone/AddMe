# Add Me
This application is an improvement on the currently tedious contact sharing options available. It allows the user to [create a profile](https://github.com/SCCapstone/AddMe/wiki/Detailed-Design#sign-up-page) to which they can add their [personal](https://github.com/SCCapstone/AddMe/wiki/Detailed-Design#personal-home-page) social media and [professional](https://github.com/SCCapstone/AddMe/wiki/Detailed-Design#business-home-page) platforms of communication as well as some other contact information. This information can then be shared with other users via a [QR code](https://github.com/SCCapstone/AddMe/wiki/Detailed-Design#scannable-qr-code-page) that is generated based on the information the user chooses to share. Users can also scan another userâ€™s [QR code](https://github.com/SCCapstone/AddMe/wiki/Detailed-Design#qr-code-scanner-page) and thus add that user's information straight to their [contacts](https://github.com/SCCapstone/AddMe/wiki/Detailed-Design#contacts-page).
