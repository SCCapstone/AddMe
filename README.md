# Add Me
This application is an improvement on the currently tedious contact sharing options available. It allows the user to create a profile to which they can add their social media and professional platforms of communication as well as some other contact information. This information can then be shared with other users via a QR code that is generated based on the information the user chooses to share. Users can also scan another userâ€™s QR code and thus add their information straight to their contacts.
